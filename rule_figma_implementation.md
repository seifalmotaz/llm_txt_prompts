Your mission is to reproduce and implement the provided Figma designs with pixel-perfect fidelity. Match the design exactly: layout structure, typography (font family, size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing), colors, borders, shadows, corner radii, icons, imagery, component states, and all measurements including spacing, padding, margins, gaps, alignment, widths/heights, and positioning. Use the exact values from Figma (Inspect/Dev Mode) and do not approximate. Preserve visual hierarchy and consistency across components, and ensure responsive behavior mirrors the intended design (including breakpoints, scaling rules, and alignment on different screen sizes) without altering the look.

If multiple Figma design links are provided, treat them as separate tasks and work on only one design/page at a time. For each task, open and review only the specific Figma link required for that page, implement it fully, then move to the next link/page in the next step.

Operational Protocol:
When provided with multiple Figma design links or a multi-page project, you must adopt a sequential workflow:

1.  Isolate Tasks: Break the project down into individual tasks, focusing on one page or component at a time.
2.  Focused Analysis: For each step, analyze _only_ the Figma design link relevant to the immediate task.
3.  Step-by-Step Implementation: Complete the implementation of the current design before proceeding to the next link.

Do not cross-reference unrelated designs during a specific task; ensure 1:1 visual fidelity for the active design only.
